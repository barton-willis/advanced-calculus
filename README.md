# Advanced calculus resources

For two decades, I regularly taught undergraduate advanced calculus MATH 460 (real analysis) at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. This depository contains class notes, homework, and other resources that I used for this class in the fall 2023 term. 

For many years, I used the textbook _An introduction to analysis_, 2nd edition by James Kirkwood, but for the most part, I invented my own problem sets. In August 2024, I retired from UNK, but from time-to-time, I will work on extending my solutions to homework sets and tidying my class notes.

Since I last taught this class in fall 2023, the ability of generative AI systems to solve analysis homework has greatly increased. I will leave it to my junior colleagues to find ways
to navigate the use of AI in analysis classes.
