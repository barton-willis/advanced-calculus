# Advanced calculus resources

For twenty-five years, I regularly taught undergraduate advanced calculus MATH 460 (real analysis) at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. The class members were mathematics and
mathematics education majors, and occasionally a science major. I would say that my class
was traditional. By that, I mean that it wasn't inquiry based or historically based.
This depository contains class notes, homework, and other resources that I used for this 
class in the fall 2023 term. 

Some of the handouts were refined over many years, others were new. So the quality of the class notes might vary; however, public humiliation is a great motivator for me, and once I started putting class materials on GitHub instead of squirreling them away on Canvas, I took more time  proofreading my work. If you find errors or have suggestions, please put a message on the discussion board.

For many years, I used the textbook _An introduction to analysis_, 2nd edition, by James Kirkwood, but generally, I invented my own problem sets and I did not assign problems
from the textbook. Although I retired from UNK in August 2024, from time-to-time, I will 
work on extending my solutions to homework sets and tidying my class notes. If you all
find these notes useful, send me a note and maybe it will motivate me to make further
improvements.

Since I last taught this class in fall 2023, the ability of generative AI systems to solve analysis homework (and typeset the work in LaTeX) has greatly increased. I will leave it to my junior colleagues to find ways to navigate the use of AI in analysis classes.
