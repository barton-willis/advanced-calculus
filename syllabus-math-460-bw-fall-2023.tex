\subsubsection*{Important Dates}

\begin{mypar}{0.25in}{0.25in} 

      \textbf{First Homework due} \dotfill  \printdate{27/8/\the\year}  \\
       \textbf{Exam 1} \dotfill \printdate{23/9/\the\year}  \\

      \textbf{Final exam} \dotfill  \finaldateandtime
\end{mypar}



\subsubsection*{Grading}

Your course grade will be based on weekly homework sets, three midterm exams, and a comprehensive 
final exam; specifically:
\begin{mypar}{0.25in}{0.25in}
    \textbf{Weekly Homework:}  \emph{12 fifteen point assignments}  \dotfill 180 (total) \\
    \textbf{Mid-term exams 1,2, and 3:} \emph{100 points each} \dotfill 300 (total)\\
      \textbf{Comprehensive Final exam} \dotfill 150 (total)
\end{mypar}
If we end the term with less than 180 points for homework,  your homework point total will be scaled to a total of 180. 

\FPeval{\points}{round(12*15+300+150,0)}

\FPeval{\F}{round(\points*0.6-1,0)}
\FPeval{\Dm}{round(\points*0.6,0)}
\FPeval{\D}{round(\points*0.633,0)}
\FPeval{\Dp}{round(\points*0.6667,0)}

\FPeval{\Cm}{round(\points*0.7,0)}
\FPeval{\C}{round(\points*0.733,0)}
\FPeval{\Cp}{round(\points*0.7667,0)}

\FPeval{\Bm}{round(\points*0.8,0)}
\FPeval{\B}{round(\points*0.833,0)}
\FPeval{\Bp}{round(\points*0.8667,0)}

\FPeval{\Am}{round(\points*0.9,0)}
\FPeval{\A}{round(\points*0.933,0)}
\FPeval{\Ap}{round(\points*0.99,0)}

The following table shows the \emph{minimum} number of points (out of \points) that
are required for each of the twelve letter grades D- through A+. For
example, a point total of \Bp\/  points will earn you a grade of B+,  and 
a point total of \Am\/ points will earn you a grade of A-. If you earn a point
total of \F\/  or less, you a failing course grade.

\subsubsection*{Course Resources}

Our textbook is \emph{An Introduction to Analysis}, \nth{2} edition, Waveland Press, Prospect Heights, Illinois, 2002 (ISBN 13: 978-1-57766-232-7) by James Kirkwood. The book by the same author and title, but published by PWS Publishing Company (Boston, 1995, ISBN 13:
0-534-94422-1) is identical.

 Some homework assignments for this course will need to be typeset. To do this, you will need to create a \emph{no cost} 
account on Overleaf (\url{https://www.overleaf.com/}).   For a  tutorial for using Overleaf, see \url{https://www.overleaf.com/tutorial}.



\subsubsection*{Course Calendar}

Generally, we'll adhere to the scheduled exam dates even if we are ahead or behind with coursework.  
When we are ahead or behind, the topics on the exams will be appropriately adjusted.

\subsubsection*{University Policies}

\paragraph*{Student Attendance Policy Statement}

Students are expected to attend all meetings of classes for which they are 
registered, including the first and last scheduled meetings and the final 
examination period. Instructors hold the right and responsibility to 
establish attendance policies for their courses. Each instructor must 
inform all classes at the beginning of each semester concerning their 
attendance policies.

Participation in official University activities, serious health concerns, 
personal emergencies, and religious observances are valid reasons for absence 
from classes. Students are responsible for informing their instructors prior 
to their absence(s) from class and for completing assignments missed during 
their absence(s). No adverse or prejudicial effects shall result to any student 
with a documented, excused absence.  

Questions may be directed to the Dean of Student Affairs office or to Student 
Health \& Counseling.

\paragraph{Academic Honesty Policy} Academic honesty is essential to the existence 
and integrity of an institution of higher education.  The responsibility for 
maintaining that integrity is shared by all members of the academic community.  
o further serve this end, the University of Nebraska at Kearney has a policy 
relating to academic integrity.   

\paragraph{Reporting Student Sexual Harassment, Sexual Violence or Sexual Assault}

Reporting allegations of rape, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, 
sexual harassment, and stalking enables the University to promptly provide support 
to the impacted student(s), and to take appropriate action to prevent a recurrence 
of such sexual misconduct and protect the campus community. Confidentiality will 
be respected to the greatest degree possible. Any student who believes they may 
be the victim of sexual misconduct is encouraged to report to one or more of 
the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Local Domestic Violence, Sexual Assault Advocacy Agency 
      \phonenumber[country=US]{3082372599}

  \item Campus Police (or Security) \phonenumber[country=US]{3088658911}

  \item Title IX Coordinator \phonenumber[country=US]{3088658655}
\end{itemize}
Retaliation against the student making the report, whether by students or 
University employees, will not be tolerated.

\paragraph{Students with Disabilities} It is the policy of the University of Nebraska 
at Kearney to provide flexible and individualized reasonable accommodation 
to students with documented disabilities. To receive accommodation services 
for a disability, students must be registered with the UNK Disabilities Services 
for Students (DSS) office, 175 Memorial Student Affairs Building, 
\phonenumber[country=US]{3088658214} or by email 
\href{mailto:unkdso@unk.edu}{unkdso@unk.edu}  


\paragraph{Students Who are Pregnant} It is the policy of the University of Nebraska at Kearney to provide flexible and 
individualized reasonable accommodation to students who are pregnant. To receive 
accommodation services due to pregnancy, students must contact the 
Student Health office at \phonenumber[country=US]{3088658218}. The following links provide information

\paragraph{UNK Statement of Diversity \& Inclusion}

UNK stands in solidarity and unity with our students of color, our Latinx 
and international students, our LGBTQIA+ students and students from other 
marginalized groups in opposition to racism and prejudice in any form, 
wherever it may exist. It is the job of institutions of higher education, 
indeed their duty, to provide a haven for the safe and meaningful exchange of 
ideas and to support peaceful disagreement and discussion. In our classes, 
we strive to maintain a positive learning environment based upon open 
communication and mutual respect. UNK does not discriminate on the basis of 
race, color, national origin, age, religion, sex, gender, sexual orientation, 
disability or political affiliation. Respect for the diversity of our backgrounds 
and varied life experiences is essential to learning from our similarities as 
well as our differences. The following link provides resources and other 
information regarding D\&I: \url{https://www.unk.edu/about/equity-access-diversity.php}

\subsubsection* {Policies}

Unless an assessment is \emph{explicitly} stated to be a group project,  \emph{all work you turn in for a grade must be your own.}  If you need assistance in completing a homework assignment, you may ask me for help. Googling for answers, seeking help from the Learning Commons or other faculty members,  or using solution keys from previous terms (either from UNK or other universities) is also prohibited.  Violation of these rules will result in earning a grade of zero on the assessment. Each homework assignment you turn in for a grade must include the statement:

\begin{quote}
\fbox{I have neither given nor received unauthorized assistance on this assignment.}
\end{quote}
 If two assignments are so similar that only collaboration could explain their similarities, both assignments will receive a grade of zero.  Using unauthorized materials or communication devices (cell phone, for
example) while taking a test will earn you a grade of zero on that assessment.  

 

\begin{enumerate}

\item Regular in person class attendance is required. If you are ill or need to miss 
class due to athletics, please let me know ahead of time and I will make an effort to put the class on Zoom.

\item For examinations and in class assignments, show your work.  \emph{No credit will be given for multi-step problems without the necessary work. Your solution must contain enough detail
so that I am convinced that you could correctly work any similar problem.} Also erase or clearly mark any work you want me to ignore; otherwise,
I'll grade it.  

\item The work you turn in is expected to be \emph{accurate, 
complete, concise, neat}, and \emph{well-organized}.  
\emph{You will not earn full credit on work that falls short of 
these expectations.}

\item Class cancellations due to weather, illness, or other 
unplanned circumstances may require that we make  adjustments
to the course calendar, exam dates, and due dates or specifics for 
course assessments. 


\item Extra credit is not allowed. 



\item For examinations, you may use a teacher provided quick reference sheet, 
but no other reference materials. You may also use a pencil, eraser, 
and a scientific calculator. For examinations, your phone and all such
devices must be turned off and \emph{out of sight}. 

\item Generally, if you are ill or absent for any reason (including 
athletics), you must turn in your in class work on time. Permission to
turn in work late must be made in advance, otherwise late in class work 
will count zero points.


 

\item During class time, please refrain from using electronic devices. If your 
device usage distracts your classmates, I will ask you to put it away. If it's my 
impression that you are often not paying attention in class, I reserve the right to 
decline to help you during office hours.

\item The final examination will be \emph{comprehensive} and it will be given 
during the  time scheduled by the University. Except for \emph{extraordinary circumstances}
you must take the exam at this time.
 
\item If you have questions about how your work has been graded, make an appointment with me immediately.


\item Please regularly check Canvas  to verify that your scores have 
been recorded correctly.  If I made a mistake in recording one of
your grades, I'll correct it provided you saved your paper.
